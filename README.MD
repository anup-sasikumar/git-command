#This is a practice repository having all GIT commands

##Commands Used:
- git init : creates a repository
- git status : compares working directory, staging area and current branch
- git add : add all the changes at that point in time from working directory to staging area
- git commit : commit the changes from staging area to the current branch
- git config : set or get the configuration parameters
- git log : show history of project commits
- git checkout -b : creates a new branch and switches to it

##To understand stash
- git stash : stores the uncommitted changes from working directory and index state as WIP
- git stash list : lists the uncommitted changes in the current branch
- git stash pop : apply the uncommitted changes back to the working directory
