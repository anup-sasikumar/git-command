#This is a practice repository having all GIT commands

##Commands Used:
- git init : creates a new GIT repository
- git status : compares working directory, staging area and current branch
- git add : add all the changes at that point in time from working directory to staging area
- git commit : commit the changes from staging area to the current branch
- git config : set or get the configuration parameters
- git log : show history of project commits
- git merge : Merge changes from different branches

##Merge operation brings changes from one branch into another
A fast-forward merge happens when the target branch (merged_branch) was branched from the current branch (master) and there are no changes to current branch since then.
